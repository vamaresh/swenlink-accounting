# Testing Instructions

## Current Status

### ✅ Working: `index.html` (Free Version - localStorage)
- Open `index.html` in browser
- All features work with localStorage
- Data persists locally only
- No authentication required

### 🚧 In Progress: Premium Version (Clerk + Supabase)
- Database schema created in Supabase
- Storage bucket configured
- Ready for integration

## Admin Email
**amareshvel@gmail.com** - Will get free admin access

## Next Steps
The premium integration requires careful implementation due to file size (1676 lines).

**Options:**
1. Create minimal proof-of-concept first
2. Implement feature-by-feature migration  
3. Build separate lightweight premium version

Please confirm which approach you'd prefer for the premium implementation.
